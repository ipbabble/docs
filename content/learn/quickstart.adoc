== Patterns quick start

Each pattern can be deployed using the command line. The only requirement is to have `git` and `podman` installed. See the <<installation_prerequisites>> for more information.

Patterns deployment requires several tools including Helm to install. However, the validated patterns framework removes the need to install and maintain these tools. The `pattern.sh` script uses a container which includes the necessary tools. The use of that container is why you need to install `podman`.

Check the `values-\*.yaml` for changes that are needed before deployment. After changing the `values-*.yaml` files where needed and pushing them to your git repository, you can run `./pattern.sh make install` from your local repository directory and that will deploy the datacenter/hub cluster for a pattern. Edge clusters are deployed by joining/importing them into ACM on the hub.

Alternatively to the `./pattern.sh make install` method, you can use the https://operatorhub.io/operator/patterns-operator[validated pattern operator] available in the OpenShift console.

For information on using the Validated Patterns Operator, see link:/infrastructure/using-validated-pattern-operator/[Using the Validated Pattern Operator].

Follow any other post-install instructions for the pattern on that patternâ€™s Getting started page.


== Prerequisite installation instructions [[installation_prerequisites]]

== Tested Operating systems
The following instructions have been tested on the following operating systems:

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and 9
* CentOS 8 and 9
* Fedora 36 and onwards
* Debian Bookworm
* Ubuntu 22.04
* Mac OSX Big Sur and onwards

=== Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and 9
Make sure that you have both the `appstream` and the `baseos` repositories configured.
For example on RHEL 8 you will get the following:

[source,terminal]
----
sudo dnf repolist
Updating Subscription Management repositories.
repo id                               repo name
rhel-8-for-x86_64-appstream-rpms      Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 for x86_64 - AppStream (RPMs)
rhel-8-for-x86_64-baseos-rpms         Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 for x86_64 - BaseOS (RPMs)
